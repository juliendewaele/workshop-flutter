# Wish List App
    
Exercise 1: Create a class named Wish that contains a title and a description. Then, create a class constructor to create multiple wishes.

Exercise 2: Create a list of Wish called _myWishes and add 2 or more element in the created list. Then, create a text with the title of Wish for each element in _myWishes in a column.

Exercise 3: Make the text of the previous exercise clickable. Then, on click, open a new page and put the title of the Wish you clicked on in the appbar and write the description of the Wish in a column.

Exercise 4: Create a button in the main page to add some Wish in _myWishes, this button should open a popup window with a text field for the title, another text field for the description, a button in the bottom of the popup to cancel the action and another button to create a Wish and add it to _myWishes, both buttons should close the popup if you click on them.

Exercise 5: Create an icon or a button to delete a Wish, this button should open a popup with 2 buttons to confirm or cancel the deletion of the Wish. If confirmed, the Wish must be removed of _myWishes.
